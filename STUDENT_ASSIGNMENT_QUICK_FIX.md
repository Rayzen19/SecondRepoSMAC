# Student Assignment Fix - Quick Reference

## 🐛 The Problem
Students assigned to sections like "G-11 Baby breath" were **NOT saving** to the database - only to session storage.

## ✅ The Fix
Now students are properly saved to the `student_enrollments` table with registration numbers!

## 🎯 What Changed

### Backend (PHP)
1. **AssigningListController** - Now creates StudentEnrollment records
2. **SectionAdviserController** - Added methods to:
   - Get students from database (`getSectionStudents`)
   - Get section counts from database (`getSectionCounts`)
   - Remove students from database (`removeStudent`)

### Frontend (JavaScript)
1. **viewSectionDetails()** - Loads students from database
2. **updateStudentCounts()** - Loads counts from database

## 📊 How It Works Now

```
User assigns student → Click "Save" → StudentEnrollment created in DB
                                    → Registration number generated
                                    → Section count updated

View section → Fetch from DB → Display students with reg numbers
```

## 🧪 Quick Test

1. Go to **Assigning List**
2. Assign a student to "G-11 Baby breath"
3. Click **"Save All Assignments"**
4. Go to **Section & Advisers**
5. **Check:** Section shows student count
6. Click **"View students"**
7. **Check:** Student appears with registration number
8. **Close browser** (clear session)
9. **Reopen** and go to Section & Advisers
10. **✅ Student is STILL there!**

## 🔑 Key Features

- ✅ Persists to database (not just session)
- ✅ Auto-generates registration numbers (REG-2025-00001)
- ✅ Shows on Section & Advisers page
- ✅ Displays real-time student counts
- ✅ Handles duplicate enrollments
- ✅ Validates academic year, strand, and section

## 📝 Database Table Used

**student_enrollments:**
- `student_id` → Which student
- `academic_year_strand_section_id` → Which section (in which year/strand)
- `registration_number` → Unique ID
- `status` → enrolled/dropped/completed

## 🚀 New API Endpoints

```php
POST /admin/section-advisers/get-section-students
  → Returns students in a specific section

POST /admin/section-advisers/get-section-counts
  → Returns student counts for all sections

POST /admin/assigning-list/save-assignments
  → Saves student assignments to database (UPDATED)
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Always click "Save All Assignments"** after assigning students
2. Student counts update automatically when you view the page
3. Registration numbers are unique per academic year
4. Removing a student deletes from database (not just session)
5. If section doesn't show students, check:
   - Active academic year exists
   - Section has academic_year_strand_section record
   - Students were saved (not just assigned)

## 🎨 Visual Indicators

- **Badge colors** on student info:
  - Gray = Student number
  - Blue = Program/Strand
  - Light blue = Academic year
  - Green = Registration number *(NEW!)*
