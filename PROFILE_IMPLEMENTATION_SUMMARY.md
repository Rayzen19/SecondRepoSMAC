## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Images not showing?
1. Check if storage link exists: `php artisan storage:link`
2. Verify APP_URL in `.env` file
3. Check file permissions on storage directory

### Upload fails?
1. Check `php.ini` settings for `upload_max_filesize` and `post_max_size`
2. Verify storage directory has write permissions
3. Check available disk space

### Validation errors?
- Ensure email and contact numbers are unique across students table
- Check that required fields are filled
- Verify password meets minimum requirements
