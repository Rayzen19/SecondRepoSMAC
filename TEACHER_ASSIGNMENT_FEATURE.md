# Teacher Assignment Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This feature allows administrators to manage teacher assignments by assigning strands, sections, and subjects to teachers.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Assignment Button in Teacher List**
- Added an "Assignment" button in the teacher list table (`resources/views/admin/teachers/index.blade.php`)
- Icon: Clipboard (`ti ti-clipboard-text`)
- Location: Between "Edit" and "Delete" buttons

### 2. **Routes Added**
Three new routes were added to `routes/web.php`:
- `GET /teachers/{teacher}/assignments` - Display assignment page
- `POST /teachers/{teacher}/assignments` - Create new assignment
- `DELETE /teachers/{teacher}/assignments/{assignment}` - Delete assignment

### 3. **Controller Methods**
Added three new methods to `TeacherController`:

#### `assignments(Teacher $teacher)`
- Displays the assignment management page
- Loads all academic years, strands, sections, and subjects
- Shows existing assignments for the teacher

#### `storeAssignment(Request $request, Teacher $teacher)`
- Creates a new assignment for the teacher
- Validates input (academic year, strand, subject are required)
- Prevents duplicate assignments
- Stores grade percentages (Written Works, Performance Tasks, Quarterly Assessment)

#### `deleteAssignment(Teacher $teacher, AcademicYearStrandSubject $assignment)`
- Deletes an assignment
- Verifies the assignment belongs to the teacher

### 4. **Assignment Page Features**
Created `resources/views/admin/teachers/assignments.blade.php` with:

#### Teacher Information Display
- Shows teacher's name, employee number, and department

#### Assignment Form
- **Academic Year dropdown** - Select from available academic years
- **Strand dropdown** - Select from active strands
- **Subject dropdown** - Select from available subjects
- **Grade Percentages** (optional, collapsible section):
  - Written Works % (default: 30%)
  - Performance Tasks % (default: 50%)
  - Quarterly Assessment % (default: 20%)

#### Existing Assignments Table
Shows all current assignments with:
- Academic Year and semester
- Strand code and name
- Subject code and name
- Grade percentages (WW, PT, QA)
- Creation date
- Delete action button

## How to Use

1. **Navigate to Teacher List**
   - Go to Admin → Teachers → Teacher List

2. **Click Assignment Button**
   - Click the clipboard icon for any teacher

3. **Create Assignment**
   - Select Academic Year, Strand, and Subject

4. **View Assignments**
   - All existing assignments are displayed in the table below

5. **Delete Assignment**

## Database Structure
The assignments are stored in the `academic_year_strand_subjects` table with these key fields:
- `teacher_id` - Teacher assigned
- `academic_year_id` - Academic year
- `strand_id` - Strand
- `subject_id` - Subject
- `written_works_percentage` - Grade weight for written works
- `performance_tasks_percentage` - Grade weight for performance tasks
- `quarterly_assessment_percentage` - Grade weight for quarterly assessment

## Validation Rules
- Academic Year, Strand, and Subject are required
- Duplicate assignments are prevented (same teacher, year, strand, subject combination)
- Grade percentages must be between 0-100
- Only the assigned teacher's assignments can be deleted

## Success/Error Messages
