### Status Logic:
- **Active**: `is_active = true` AND published AND not expired
- **Scheduled**: `is_active = true` AND `published_at > now()`
- **Expired**: `expires_at < now()`
- **Inactive**: `is_active = false`

### Performance:
- Optimized queries using Eloquent relationships
- Only top 5 announcements loaded for dashboard
- Statistics use efficient count queries
- No N+1 query issues
