# Announcement System Implementation Summary

## Overview
A complete announcement management system has been implemented for St. Matthew Academy of Cavite. Administrators can create, edit, and delete announcements that will be displayed on the landing page.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database & Model
- **Table**: `announcements`
- **Fields**:
  - `id` (primary key)
  - `title` (string, required)
  - `description` (text, nullable - existing field)
  - `content` (text, required)
  - `image_url` (string, nullable)
  - `is_active` (boolean, default true)
  - `published_at` (timestamp, nullable)
  - `expires_at` (timestamp, nullable)
  - `created_by` (foreign key to users table)
  - `created_at`, `updated_at` (timestamps)

- **Model**: `App\Models\Announcement`
  - Scopes: `active()`, `latest()`
  - Relationships: `creator()` (belongs to User)
  - Helper methods: `isExpired()`, `isPublished()`

### 2. Admin Panel Features

#### Routes
All routes are under `/admin/announcements` with `auth:admin` middleware:
- `GET /admin/announcements` - List all announcements
- `GET /admin/announcements/create` - Create form
- `POST /admin/announcements` - Store new announcement
- `GET /admin/announcements/{announcement}/edit` - Edit form
- `PUT /admin/announcements/{announcement}` - Update announcement

#### Controller
**Location**: `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/AnnouncementController.php`

**Methods**:
- `index()` - Display all announcements with pagination
- `create()` - Show creation form
- `store()` - Validate and save new announcement
- `edit()` - Show edit form
- `update()` - Validate and update announcement
- `destroy()` - Delete announcement

**Validation Rules**:

- `image_url`: nullable, valid URL, max 500 characters
- `is_active`: boolean
- `published_at`: nullable, date
- `expires_at`: nullable, date, must be after or equal to published_at

#### Views
**Location**: `resources/views/admin/announcements/`

1. **index.blade.php** - List view
   - Shows all announcements in a table
   - Status badges (Active, Scheduled, Expired, Inactive)
   - Edit and Delete actions
   - Pagination support
   - Empty state with "Create first announcement" prompt

2. **create.blade.php** - Creation form
   - Title input (required)
   - Content textarea (required)
   - Image URL input (optional)
   - Publish date picker (optional, defaults to immediate)
   - Expiration date picker (optional, defaults to no expiration)
   - Active checkbox (visible on landing page)
   - Form validation with error display

3. **edit.blade.php** - Edit form
   - Same fields as create form
   - Pre-filled with existing data
   - Shows current image if available

### 3. Navigation
**Location**: `resources/views/admin/components/template.blade.php`

Added "Announcements" menu item:
- Icon: `ti-speakerphone`
- Position: After Attendance, before Section & Advisers
- Active state highlighting when on announcements pages

### 4. Landing Page Integration
**Location**: `resources/views/welcome.blade.php`

**Announcement Section**:
- Displays up to 3 most recent active announcements
- Shows announcement title, content (truncated to 120 chars), and image
- Displays published date
- Falls back to icon placeholder if no image provided
- Empty state message when no announcements exist
- Responsive card layout with info theme styling

**Data Flow**:
- Route `/` queries `Announcement::active()->latest()->take(3)->get()`
- Only shows announcements that are:
  - Marked as active
  - Published (published_at is null or in the past)
  - Not expired (expires_at is null or in the future)

### 5. Sample Data
**Seeder**: `database/seeders/AnnouncementSeeder.php`

Creates 3 sample announcements:
1. "Welcome to School Year 2025-2026" - No expiration
2. "Enrollment Period Extended" - Expires Oct 31, 2025
3. "Parent-Teacher Conference Schedule" - Expires Nov 16, 2025

Run with: `php artisan db:seed --class=AnnouncementSeeder`

## Technical Details

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE announcements (
    id BIGINT UNSIGNED PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    image_url VARCHAR(255) NULL,
    is_active TINYINT(1) DEFAULT 1,
    published_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    created_by BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (created_by) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);
```

### Active Announcements Logic
An announcement is considered "active" if:
1. `is_active = true`
2. `published_at` is NULL or <= current time
3. `expires_at` is NULL or >= current time

This is handled by the `active()` scope in the Announcement model.

### Image Handling
- Currently uses external URLs (Unsplash, etc.)
- Future enhancement: Add file upload capability
- Images are optional; default icon placeholder used if none provided

## Future Enhancements

1. **File Upload**: Allow admins to upload images instead of URLs only
2. **Rich Text Editor**: Add WYSIWYG editor for content formatting
3. **Categories**: Add announcement categories (Academic, Events, etc.)
4. **Priority/Pinning**: Allow pinning important announcements to top
5. **Notification**: Send email/push notifications for new announcements
6. **Draft Mode**: Save drafts before publishing
7. **View Counter**: Track how many times announcement is viewed
8. **Comments**: Allow users to comment on announcements
9. **Archive**: Soft delete with archive feature
10. **Search/Filter**: Add search and filtering in admin list

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [x] Create announcement with all fields
- [x] Create announcement with minimal fields (title + content only)
- [x] Edit existing announcement
- [x] Delete announcement
- [x] View announcements on landing page
- [x] Test scheduled announcement (future published_at)
- [x] Test expired announcement (past expires_at)
- [x] Toggle active/inactive status
- [x] Navigation menu highlights correctly
- [x] Form validation works
- [x] Pagination works (if more than 15 announcements)

### Sample Data
Run the seeder to test with sample data:
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=AnnouncementSeeder
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Column not found: content"
**Solution**: Run the update migration:
```bash
php artisan migrate --path=database/migrations/2025_10_18_080311_update_announcements_table_structure.php
```

### Issue: "Field 'description' doesn't have a default value"
**Solution**: The description field exists in the table and has been made nullable.

### Issue: Announcements not showing on landing page
**Check**:
1. Is announcement marked as active?
2. Is published_at in the past or NULL?
3. Is expires_at in the future or NULL?
4. Clear cache: `php artisan cache:clear`
