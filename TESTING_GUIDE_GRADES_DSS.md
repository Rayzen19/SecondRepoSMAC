## Browser Compatibility Testing

Test in multiple browsers:
- [ ] Chrome
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Safari
- [ ] Edge

## Mobile Device Testing

Test on actual devices or emulators:
- [ ] iPhone/iOS
- [ ] Android
- [ ] Tablet

## Performance Testing

### Check Page Load Times:
- [ ] Grades page loads < 2 seconds
- [ ] Decision Support page loads < 2 seconds
- [ ] Chart.js loads properly
- [ ] No console errors

## Database Verification

### Check if data is correctly retrieved:
```sql
-- Check student enrollments
SELECT * FROM student_enrollments WHERE student_id = [YOUR_STUDENT_ID];

-- Check subject enrollments with grades
SELECT se.*, s.name as subject_name, s.code as subject_code
FROM subject_enrollments se
JOIN academic_year_strand_subjects ayss ON se.academic_year_strand_subject_id = ayss.id
JOIN subjects s ON ayss.subject_id = s.id
WHERE se.student_enrollment_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM student_enrollments WHERE student_id = [YOUR_STUDENT_ID]
);
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Chart not displaying
**Solution:**
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify Chart.js CDN is accessible
- Clear browser cache

### Issue 2: No grades showing
**Solution:**
- Verify student has enrollments in database
- Check if grades are populated (fq_grade, sq_grade, etc.)
- Verify academic year is correct

### Issue 3: Sidebar items not highlighting
**Solution:**
- Check route names in `web.php`
- Verify `$routeIs()` function in template
- Clear Laravel route cache: `php artisan route:clear`

### Issue 4: Page not loading
**Solution:**
- Check Laravel logs: `storage/logs/laravel.log`
- Verify all controllers are properly created
- Run `composer dump-autoload`

### Issue 5: Performance data showing 0%
**Solution:**
- This is expected with mock data
- Implement real performance calculation from assessment records
- Check `GradeController` line 75-82

## Automated Testing (Optional)

Create automated tests:

```php
// tests/Feature/GradePageTest.php
public function test_student_can_view_grades()
{
    $student = Student::factory()->create();
    
    $response = $this->actingAs($student, 'student')
                     ->get(route('student.grades.index'));
    
    $response->assertStatus(200);
    $response->assertViewIs('student.grades.index');
}

// tests/Feature/DecisionSupportTest.php
public function test_student_can_view_decision_support()
{
    $student = Student::factory()->create();
    
    $response = $this->actingAs($student, 'student')
                     ->get(route('student.decision-support.index'));
    
    $response->assertStatus(200);
    $response->assertViewIs('student.decision-support.index');
